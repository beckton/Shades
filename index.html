            <p>&quot;My sister got me this pair in pink for my birthday and I just love them!
			They are my go-to pair of shades now. The lense is not too dark, just right, and they
			really make the sunset stand out. It's like walking around in a beautiful painting, and
			I can't wait to buy my next pair, I'm thinking Navy!&quot;</p>
